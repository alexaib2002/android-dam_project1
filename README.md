This project implements the following new functionality:

- Responsive design, by making use of ConstraintLayouts instead of RelativeLayouts.
- Replacement of FrameLayout with ConstraintLayout for Fragments.
- App icon
- Real data management (the requriements stated the app should simulate data management; this one instead makes use of Serializable JavaBeans and ArrayLists to move data around Insert and Query activities)
